# Next.js 15 App Router Redirect Issue

This repository demonstrates a bug encountered in Next.js 15's App Router when redirecting between pages using both `next/link` and `useRouter.push()`.  Under certain conditions, the redirect fails, leading to unpredictable behavior.

## Bug Description

The provided code includes two pages: `index.js` and `about.js`.  Navigating from `index.js` to `about.js` using a `<Link>` component works correctly. However, attempting to redirect back to the home page from `about.js` using `router.push('/')` sometimes fails. The app may hang, display an error message, or exhibit other unexpected behavior.

## Steps to Reproduce

1. Clone this repository.
2. Run `npm install` to install dependencies.
3. Start the development server using `npm run dev`.
4. Navigate to the about page using the link on the home page.
5. Click the "Go back to Home" button. Observe that the redirect may fail.

## Potential Causes

The root cause is likely related to how Next.js 15's App Router handles client-side navigation and redirects, particularly in conjunction with component lifecycle events.  Further investigation is needed to pinpoint the exact cause.

## Workaround

See the `bugSolution.js` file for a potential workaround, although further investigation is needed to fully understand and address the root cause of the issue.
